# Contributing to the SOF language implementation.

There are three main ways of contributing:

1. Improve the interpreter by adding features of the language that are documented but not yet implemented. It is best to first contact @kleinesfilmroellchen so that no duplicate work is done.

2. Try out the interpreter, experiment with edge cases and file bug reports for bugs that occur. Please stick to the bug report template for such bug reports.

3. Suggest and discuss language changes and extensions in the Issues section.

4. Write tutorials and examples for SOF and submit them for inclusion in the documentation by making a pull request to the wiki.

Code should follow the general Java code style as well as being readable and well-documented.
