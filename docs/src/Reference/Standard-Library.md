# The SOF standard library

This is the official collection of library functions and classes provided by the SOF system.

<!-- ## How to write your own library

A library is simply a collection of related functionality, possibly implemented in a native Java class (explanation/implementation plan coming soon!). The tool `sof packlib` can pack a library by investigating the current or a given directory and combining all the found `.sof` source files into one `.soflib` file that is recognized by SOF's `use` PT. -->

## Files in the standard library

- `math`: Usual mathematical operations.
- `op`: (Not implemented) Built-in operations as callables.
- `io`: (Not implemented) File input/output.
- `list`: (Not implemented) List functions.
